### Hey, I'm Rohan! 👋

#### A few details about me:
- I'm a sophomore in the Computer Science department at Princeton University. I'm also pursuing minors in Statistics & Machine Learning and Technology & Society. 
- On campus and virtually, I'm a co-director of [Princeton Rehack](http://rehack.co), a [Peer Academic Advisor](https://forbescollege.princeton.edu/people/peer-academic-advisers-paa), a member of the [Princeton Debate Panel](http://debate.princeton.edu), a [CS Lab Teaching Assistant](http://labta.cs.princeton.edu), and a violist in the [Princeton University Orchestra](http://orchestra.princeton.edu). 
- I'm particularly interested in the applications of Computer Science to different domains. I've previously explored CS applications to healthcare, security, and food science.
- This summer, I worked on an NLP project at Black Sheep Foods to assist food scientists with the R&D process. You can check out my work [here](http://www.github.com/bcatoto/bsf). To see the operational website, go [here](http://shearlock.blacksheepfoods.com).
- In my free time, I enjoy exploring hiking trails and composing music. I'm also looking for book recommendations!
- If you'd like to say hello, feel free to reach out via [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rjinturkar). Look forward to meeting you!
