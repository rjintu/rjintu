### Hey, I'm Rohan! 👋

#### A little bit about me:
- 🎒 I'm an undergraduate in the Computer Science department at Princeton University, currently working in the [Visual AI lab](https://visualai.princeton.edu). I've been fortunate to be advised by [Olga Russakovsky](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/) and [Christiane Fellbaum](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~fellbaum/).
- 🍔 I previously interned at Microsoft, Marmalade Labs, Black Sheep Foods, and many other places.
- 🎻 I've led the [Princeton Entrepreneurship Club](http://princetoneclub.com), supported freshmen as a [Peer Academic Advisor](https://forbescollege.princeton.edu/people/peer-academic-advisers-paa), debated with the [Princeton Debate Panel](http://debate.princeton.edu), helped students [debug code](http://labta.cs.princeton.edu), and played viola in the [Princeton University Orchestra](http://orchestra.princeton.edu).
- ⚡ Currently, I'm organizing a [trip to Silicon Valley](http://svtigertrek.com) to meet legendary VCs, founders, and execs. 
- 🔭 I'm particularly interested in ML explainability and tech ethics. 
- 🏃 Some of my other interests: hiking, viola, music composition, international politics.
